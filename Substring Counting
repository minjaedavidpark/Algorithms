#As mentioned in lesson 7A, a substring is any consecutive sequence of characters inside another string. 
#The same substring may occur several times inside the same string: for example "assesses" has the substring "sses" 2 times,
#and "trans-Panamanian banana" has the substring "an" 6 times. Write a program that takes two lines of input, we call the first needle and the second haystack. 
#Print the number of times that needle occurs as a substring of haystack.





needle = input() 
haystack = input() 
counter = 0

for i in range (0,len(haystack)):
   A = haystack[i:i+len(needle)] 
   if A == needle:
      counter = counter + 1
      
print(counter)
