This program takes two lines of input. The first line is a "starting time" expressed in a 24-hour clock with leading zeroes, like 08:30 or 14:07. The second line is a duration D in minutes. Print out what time it will be D minutes after the starting time. For example, for input
12:30
47
the correct output would be 13:17. All times should be formatted as numbers between 00:00 and 23:59, but the time period may go over midnight. For example, on input
23:59
13
the correct output is 00:12. 


A = input()
B = int(input())

for position in range (0,4):
   if A[position] == ":":
      hour = int(A[0:position])
      minute = int(A[position+1:6])
      minute = minute + B
      if minute > 60:
         n = minute // 60
         hour = hour + n
         minute = minute - 60*n
         if hour >= 24:
            N = hour // 24
            hour = hour - 24*N
            
      
      
      if hour < 10:
         hour = "0" + str(hour)
      if minute < 10:
         minute = "0" + str(minute)
      time = str(hour) + ":" + str(minute)

print(time)
