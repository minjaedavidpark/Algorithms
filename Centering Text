#For this program, the first line of input is an integer width. 
#Then, there are some lines of text; the line "END" indicates the end of the text. 
#For each line of text, you need to print out a centered version of it, by adding periods .. to the left and right, so that the total length of each line of text is width. 
#(All input lines will have length at most width.) 
#Centering means that the number of periods added to the left and added to the right should be equal if possible; if needed we allow one more period on the left than the right.

while True:
   text = input()
   if text == "END":

   L = int(len(text))
